# MetaDomainHotSpot


## Software Requirements

The MetaDomain HotSpot software makes use of jupyter notebooks and requires been tested in a Linux-based OS (tested on Ubuntu 18.04), but as it is fully containerized in docker it should in theory be possible to run it on any other OS.
Please ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

	docker

You can get docker [here](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)

```
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/home/jovyan/work --name MDHS_notebook jupyter/datascience-notebook
```

```
docker exec -it MDHS_notebook bash -c 'jupyter notebook list' | grep http | cut -f1 -d ' ' | awk '{sub(/8888/, "8888")}1'
```

To shut the jupyter notebook down:
